QR CODE BULK GENERATOR PYHTON

Explanation:

bulk_generate_qr function:
This function takes the text file path and output folder path as arguments.
It checks if the output folder exists and creates it if necessary using os.makedirs.
The text file is opened in read mode ("r").
Lines are read and processed one by one using a loop.
Leading/trailing whitespaces are removed from each link using strip().
A unique filename is generated for each QR code using f-strings.
The generate_qr function is called with the extracted link and filename.
A success message is printed for each generated QR code.
User Input: The program prompts the user for the text file path and output folder path.
Bulk Generation: The bulk_generate_qr function is called with the user-provided paths.
Running the program:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., bulk_qr_generator.py).
Ensure your text file contains website links, one per line.
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script using python bulk_qr_generator.py.
Enter the path to your text file and the desired output folder path when prompted.
The program will generate QR codes for each link in the text file and save them in the specified folder with unique names.
